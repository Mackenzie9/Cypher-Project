# Mathematical Analysis of the Substitution Code
What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
There are 25 factorial possible keys. That's 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000 possible keys. 

This is because the first letter in the alphabet has 25 

If you don't have the key, you have to brute force it with a computer by trying all of the possible solutions.
