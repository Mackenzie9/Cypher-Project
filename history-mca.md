Caesar Cipher created a new way to encripit letters to numbers which were origionaly, abertrary shifts following a additive key which offer little security. Instead of adding a key number to the equivalents of the
plain text letters, he said we shall multiply by the key number. 
cyphers are have been used scince 400 BC to encripit mesages from potential interceptors the most early cyphers were additional shifts the grew to became to simple to crack.
multiplicative cyphers were created to increase the difficulty of the cypher, providing move security for meseages then before.
