A Multiplication Cypher is code that uses numbers to indicate letters. as that would be a simple cypher on its own we give it a multiplicatation key.
there are good keys and bad keys. a good key doesnt have a repeating number corolating to more than one letter. a bad key doesnt use all 0-25 numbers but uses repeting numbers within 0-25 twice or more.
good keys are: a= 3,5,7,9,11,15,17,19,21,23,25
bad keys are: a = 2,4,6,8,10,12,13,14,16,18,20,22,24
what a multiplication key of 3 would look like: 0	3	6	9	12	15	18	21	24	1	4	7	10	13	16	19	22	25	2	5	8	11	14	17	20	23
meaning A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
multiplication keys of a=0 and a=1 dont have any use as 0 turns every number to 0 and 1 doesnt scramble or change anything
